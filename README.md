## Description

The brief in this project exam was to create a personal blog, with a theme of our own choice. I chose to make a blog about interior, and called this "Pure Interior". The blog is an inspiring site where people can easy find inspiration and read about the trends in the interior world. The blog is clean, easy and modern in the design to make the user get a relaxed feeling. 

The target group for this site is women 40+ in a busy everyday lifestyle and has a hobby or interest for interior. 

The website consists of 5 pages:

- A home page with a carousel showing the latest posts uploaded to the blog.
- A list of all posts page
- A post specific page which is dynamically built based on which post the user selected. The content of the blog specific page is dynamically built using a query     string parameter based on whatever link the user clicked. If images on the blog post page are clicked, a modal appears giving the user a bigger view of that         image.
- an Exhibition site - where the user can explore all of our exhibition spaces and all the things you can do at our museum
- Checkout success
- About
- Contact (JavaScript are used for validation, shows error messages if the values in the textboxes do not meet the requirements.)
